# 1. **Twitter Scrapper AI Agent**


**Objective**: To scrape Twitter for specific keywords, hashtags, or user posts, possibly for sentiment analysis, trend tracking, or influencer identification.

**Miner's Task**: Use Twitter's API or other scraping tools to collect tweets based on predefined criteria (like specific hashtags, keywords, or from certain users).


### Key Validation Strategies for Web Scraping:

- **Data Completeness and Integrity**: Check if scraped data is complete and uncorrupted.
- **Accuracy and Relevance**: Verify accuracy of data against trusted sources and its relevance to scraping objectives.
- **Timeliness**: Ensure data is up-to-date, especially for time-sensitive analyses.
- **Ethical and Legal Compliance**: Confirm compliance with legal standards and ethical web scraping practices.


### 1. **Accuracy**
- **Definition**: Accuracy refers to how well the scraped data matches the specified criteria in the query. This includes relevance to the keywords, hashtags, or user profiles mentioned in the query.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Keyword/Hashtag Relevance**: Check if the tweets contain the exact keywords or hashtags specified in the query.
  - **Contextual Accuracy**: Assess if the tweets are contextually relevant to the query. For instance, the same keyword might have different meanings in different contexts.
  - **User-Specified Criteria**: If the query specifies tweets from certain users or during a specific event, verify that the data matches these criteria.

### 2. **Completeness**
- **Definition**: Completeness measures whether the dataset includes all tweets that fit the query parameters. This involves both the breadth (variety of sources) and depth (coverage within each source) of the data.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Volume of Data**: Ensure that the number of tweets collected aligns with what is expected based on the query's scope.
  - **Range of Sources**: If the query requires data from various users or topics, verify that the dataset reflects this diversity.
  - **Missing Data Check**: Use random sampling or automated tools to check for gaps in data collection.

### 3. **Timeliness**
- **Definition**: Timeliness refers to the promptness and currency of the data provided. This is especially crucial for time-sensitive analyses, such as tracking real-time events or trends.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Timestamp Analysis**: Ensure that the tweets collected fall within the specified time frame of the query.
  - **Real-Time Data Collection**: For real-time data requests, set up a system to monitor how quickly miners respond to and fulfill these queries.

### 4. **Data Integrity**
- **Definition**: Data Integrity ensures that the data is not altered, corrupted, or improperly formatted during the scraping and transmission process.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Original Content Verification**: Check that the content of tweets (text, images, links) is unaltered from its original form.
  - **Format Consistency**: Ensure that the data format is consistent and adheres to the specified structure (e.g., JSON, CSV) with all necessary fields (e.g., tweet text, user ID, timestamp).
  - **Data Corruption Checks**: Implement checks to detect any signs of data corruption during transfer or storage.


### Example User Queries & Validations

#### 1. Query: "Show me the latest tweets about the SpaceX launch."
- **Accuracy**: Check if the tweets specifically mention "SpaceX launch" and relate to the recent event, not past launches.
- **Completeness**: Ensure the dataset includes a comprehensive range of tweets covering various aspects of the launch, from different users, including key influencers in the space industry.
- **Timeliness**: Verify that the tweets are recent, ideally from the day of or the days following the launch.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure the content of the tweets (text, images, links) is exactly as it appears on Twitter, with no alterations.

#### 2. Query: "Gather opinions on the new iPhone model from tech experts on Twitter."
- **Accuracy**: Tweets must discuss the new iPhone model and be from recognized tech experts or credible tech news sources.
- **Completeness**: The collection should encompass a diverse range of opinions and cover various features of the iPhone.
- **Timeliness**: Tweets should be recent, focusing on the latest iPhone model, not older versions.
- **Data Integrity**: Tweets should be intact with original user handles, timestamps, and content.

#### 3. Query: "Find tweets about climate change from the last month."
- **Accuracy**: Ensure tweets are specifically about climate change, avoiding unrelated environmental topics.
- **Completeness**: Capture tweets from a broad timeframe across the entire month, from various users including climate activists, scientists, and news outlets.
- **Timeliness**: All tweets should be within the last month, not before that period.
- **Data Integrity**: Confirm that the full content of the tweets, including any linked articles or images, is accurately presented.

#### 4. Query: "Collect tweets reacting to the latest UN summit."
- **Accuracy**: Tweets need to be directly related to the latest UN summit, not previous events or general UN activities.
- **Completeness**: Aim for a well-rounded set of tweets covering different aspects of the summit, including major announcements, reactions, and key speeches.
- **Timeliness**: Focus on tweets posted during and immediately after the summit.
