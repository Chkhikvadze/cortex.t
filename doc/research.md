# Objectives

#### The primary objective is to identify and define three new validators that we can develop within the BITTENSOR network. 

The validators should focus on areas such as:

1. Twitter Data Mining: Harnessing and interpreting data from Twitter, such as tweets or trending topics, for insightful analysis. [Twitter scarpper agent](scrapper.md)

2. Music Analysis: Analyzing music data, such as genre classification or mood detection, could be another interesting area to explore. [Music analys agent](music.md)

3. Predictive Analysis: Creating predictions based on various data sources could be a valuable service. For example, predicting market trends or user behavior.
